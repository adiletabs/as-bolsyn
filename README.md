### Project description

Are you familiar with the problem of long waiting for your order in a restaurant? It would be great, if you could come to the restaurant and there was a reserved table with your order already waiting for you.

#### AsBolsyn is a platform that can make it possible! 

#### How it works?

1. Login on the website
2. Choose a desired cuisine
3. Choose a restaurant from the suggested top (don't worry that the restaurant will be bad - you can see the **reviews and comments**)
4. Choose dishes and make an order 
5. Edit order in your dishes list, if necessary. Complete your order
5. Come to the restaurant and enjoy your food!
6. Leave feedback and help others to choose the best restaurant
